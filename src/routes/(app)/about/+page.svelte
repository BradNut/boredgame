	<h1>About Bored Game</h1>
	<article>
		<p>One day we were bored and wanted to play one of our board gamesTable.</p>
		<p>Our problem was that we didn't know which one to play.</p>
		<p>Rather than just pick a game I decided to make this overcomplicated solution.</p>
		<p>I hope you enjoy using it!</p>
